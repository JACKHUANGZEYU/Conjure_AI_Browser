While you are generating the code each time, there are two principles that you need to take specific care of.Because the current project I'm working on is an AI browser project, as I add the code, it can be super large.Therefore, I give you the full right to do all sorts of modifications to all the folders and files. You can create new files and new folders, and you can merge files from merged folders, or you can split files or split folders. You can do all of those operations to all the files and folders in this project. But you don't need to do the operations to the folders and files deliberately, you know. You should change the file directory, folder directory when you think that, you know, maybe adding a file or adding a folder or doing some operations like doing merge, those kind of example, those sort of operations could help to make the file directory, to make the code more organized and neat.So yeah, as I repeat, you don't need to deliberately do that, but you need to do that when it's necessary. For example, sometimes the code is just too much, or something is just a mess. In some cases, you need to determine when to do the modifications to the file directory and folder directory. Sometimes you want to add a new function, which you think is important, and you think it's a good idea to put it in a separate new file, then you can just create a new file. You can do those sort of things. These are just examples that you need to get noticed.The second principle is that, you know, here is my current README file, and, you know, after you do each modification, then don't forget to, like, update the README file to make it, like, come up with the latest version.I'm just a beginner in programming and I heavily rely on you to do those sorts of file management stuff, you know. So, I, you know, I have no clue about, you know, how to create folders and files to keep the project, like, super organized and, you know, how to do those operations and, you know, and those kind of stuff. I just want the whole project to be easy to read, tidy, you know. So, the README file is super important. So, after you do the modifications, maybe you should check in the README file, like, update it, you know, if needed. Yeah, update the README file if it's needed. Like, something in the README file just doesn't change, just does some modifications. So, that, you know, in this case, we need to, you know, modify the README file to, like, kind of match the updates.Or sometimes, you know, maybe we get some new code and new stuff, like new folders, new files. Like, if you think it's necessary or if you think it's recommended to update the README file, yeah, you can still do the README file. You can still modify the README file.
